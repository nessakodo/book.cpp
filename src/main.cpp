/*
* Since this assignment involves testing your console inputs/outputs, the main() function will be used to call a function
 * called mainRunner(). Treat mainRunner() as if it were main() for our purposes. Since all the main() program does is
 * call mainRunner(), the actual functionality of the program will be the same
 * However, the make commands will still be `make run_main` and the tester will use `make run_main_test`
